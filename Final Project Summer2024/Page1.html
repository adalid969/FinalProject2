          <p>The first Game Boy, Model DMG-01 from Nintendo was released in 1989 and was
            Nintendo's first handheld multi-game system evolving from the Game and
            Watch handheld electronic games. The Game Boy featured some improvements over
            the Game and Watch handhelds mainly by offering a common, modular platform for different games by making use of
            both with swappable cartridge based games and a dot matrix screen instead of fixed image graphics.
            It's chunky build, bright colored buttons and green tinted screen are sure to bring you right back to 1989.
